### Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Python can be used in mutiple domains.
Because of its easy readablity,It is called high-level programming language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

 Variables in python can have different type with different time without declaration.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

pro:
Easy readablity
Time consumption
Easy to code
Can be used in multiple domains
Cons:
Slow execution.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Developing website
Data analysis
Data visualisation
Machine learing

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Variables are used for the memory allocation for the data. 
We can declare them using assignment operator.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

We can use input() for getting the input from the user.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

String the default datatype which is taken from the user as input.

Q8. What is type casting?

Converting one datatype into another datatype.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

No,we can't take more then one input from the user using single input() function because it is meant from single input.

Q10. What are keywords?

Key words are reserved words used for specific purposes

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

No we can't, because keys are specific words with purposes which can not be used as variable

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Indentation is that giving the code a format or pattern for better code standard and understanding

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

We can throw some output using print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?

Operators are symbols used between the operands for performing the any function.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

/ is the division operator for the float value.
And // is the division operator for the int value.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

value = int(input())
if value%2==0 and value != 0:
   print("The number is Even")
elif value%2!=0 and value != 0:
    print("The number is Odd")
else:
    print("Neither Even nor Odd")    

Q18. What are boolean operator?

It is an operator gives the output true or false based on the given condition.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 = 1

0 and 0 = 0

True and False and True = false

1 or 0 or 0 =1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

'if', 'elif' and 'else' are the conditional statements

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

'if' is used for checking the condition and proceed with the code.
'elif' is used if we have more than two conditions
'else' is used for the remaining conditions

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

value = input()
if value>= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
y=0
for x in range(0, len(numbers)):
    if numbers[x]%2 == 0:
       y=numbers[x]+y
print(y) 


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

value_1 = int(input())
value_2 = int(input())
value_3 = int(input())

if value_1 > value_2 and value_1 >  value_3:
    print(value_1)
elif value_2 > value_1 and value_2 > value_3:
    print(value_2)
else:
    print(value_3)
Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
for x in range(0, len(numbers)):    
    if numbers[x]%5 == 0:
       if numbers[x] > 150:
         continue
       print(numbers[x])  
       if numbers[x] > 500:  
         break
